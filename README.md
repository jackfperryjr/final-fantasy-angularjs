A Final Fantasy Compendium

```
What started as a Code Louisville FEWD project has turned into a bigger project
for me that I will continue to update periodically.

This is a compendium of Final Fantasy characters from all of the many, many games. 
(Although, not yet complete.)

## Code Louisville FE Project Notes

```
The CSS class(es) I created are:

1. .search-card
    This class contains design elements for the search box, such as size, background color, 
    margins.

2. .char-card
    This class contains design elements for the character card that displays when a character 
    is input into the search box. It's similar in design to the search box.
  
3. .char-info
    This class contains design elements for the actual character data that's displayed on the card. 
    Margins, line-height, letter-spacing.
  
4. Many more :)
```

## Custom JavaScript Functions

```
The Javascript function I created is:

AngularJs component used to read data from a JSON file. 
Many AngularJs directives used in the HTML to display said data.
