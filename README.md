A Final Fantasy Compendium
```
This is a compendium of playable Final Fantasy characters from all of the many, many games. (Although, not yet complete.)

## Code Louisville FE Project Notes
## Some Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .search-card
  This class contains design elements for the search box, such as size, background color, margins, and transistion for hover 
  effect.
  
2. .char-card
  This class contains design elements for the character card that displays when a character is input into the search box. It's
  similar in design to the search box minus the hover effect.
  
3. .char-info
  This class contains design elements for the actual character data that's displayed on the card. Margins, line-height,
  letter-spacing.
  
4. Many more :)
```

## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The Javascript function I created is:

I really only created one: an AngularJS component used to read data from a JSON file. Of course, there are many AngularJS
directives used in the HTML to display said data.
